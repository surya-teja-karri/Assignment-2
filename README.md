ASSIGNMENT-2
Snowflake ML-Powered Analysis with Streamlit Frontend 

Ad Campaign Pacing and Optimization 
We delve into the world of advertising, exploring the challenges posed by cross-channel campaigns. Our focus is on addressing the unpredictability in ad inventory across different channels, aiming to provide advertisers and media publishers with a clear projection of campaign pacing. By utilizing Snowflake's ML-Powered Analysis, we harness the power of Forecasting and Anomaly Detection to not only predict future impression volumes but also identify any anomalies that might indicate errors in campaign delivery.

E-commerce Customer Spend Prediction 
Transitioning to e-commerce, we employ Linear Regression models to analyze customer engagement across digital outlets. Our objective is to ascertain whether the mobile app experience or website engagement plays a more significant role in influencing customer spending. Utilizing a hands-on approach, we train our models locally and implement scoring within Snowflake, ensuring a seamless integration of machine learning workflows.

Maximizing ROI in Ad Spend
We extend our exploration to maximizing Return On Investment (ROI) across various advertising channels including search, video, social media, and email. By crafting an end-to-end machine learning workflow, we perform rigorous data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. The culmination of our efforts is an interactive web application, developed with Streamlit, providing real-time visualizations and insights on the impact of variable ad spend budgets on ROI.

Objective 
The primary objective of this task was to interact with Snowflake for data analysis, specifically focusing on setting up environment performing the required connetion. The backend comprised SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and running ML .We also set up our Snowflake and Python environments to build an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) workflow using Snowpark for Python and Snowpark ML.  The first front-end task was to create a Streamlit application to visualize the actual data, forecasted data, and perform anomaly detection.The Second front-end taskwas to creat a multipage streamlit app for Customer Lifetime Value computation, Predict Customer Spend and ROI Prediction.
